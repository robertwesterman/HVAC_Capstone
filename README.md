# HVAC_Capstone
Final capstone project for Springboard Data Analytics

The project core is the notebook `Building HV&ACnorm.ipynb` and it's dataset `HVAC_label.csv`.

`HVACReport.html` is output of Pandas Profiling, an automated dataframe assessment tool providing descriptive statistics and other assessments of the data.

Other notebooks are sandboxes for designing functions.

Text files are project notes.

`ENB2012_data.xlsx` is the original data as found on Data Science Dojo.

All other files are accessory and can be regenerated from the core notebook.
